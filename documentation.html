            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>This is an idle game where you play as a RIT freshman majoring in GDD. You “enroll in” classes (levels)
                to do
                exercises (enemies) of different levels, gain experience and tiger spirit. To beat the game, you must
                finish
                all your bachelor classes. </p>

        <div id="genre">
            <h2>Genre</h2>
            <p>Idle, Adventure, RPG</p>

            <p>The idea is to enjoy the gameplay, so no story included.</p>

        <div id="gameplay">
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The only control needed is the Left Mouse Button. The player makes decisions on which class to take (one
                at a
                time), which ability to practice and different classes benefit from different abilities. They can
                purchase
                ability upgrades as a multiplier on the ability value with tiger spirit. Higher levels unlock more
                powerful
                upgrades and more demanding (also more rewarding) classes. Each class has a problem-solving speed cap,
                restricting the max gain from a certain ability.<br>
                At a certain point of the game, the player will unlock “déjà vu”, which can restart the journey with a
                boosting factor based on their total exp earned. Engaging in the game gives extra rewards but the player
                can
                literally “idle” through the game. Going offline also gives rewards based on time.

        <div id="process">
            <h2>Project Process</h2>
            <p>I spent around 40 hours on this project while my time schedule is quite tight this semester (perhaps the
                same for others), but my efforts paid off.
                I had this idea because I've always loved idle games. NGU Idle, Trimps, Melvor Idle, or some good old
                others... <br>
                So I planned out the gameplay first, which is the focus of an idle game. A game of such
                genre
                can have simple graphics, no sounds and even poor instructions, but musn't no fun. Then, I made the
                general layout - where the sections should be, and there must be a nav bar... Later, I step by step
                coded corresponding classes and add visuals.<br>
                New ideas bumped out as I was working so I was able to detail each aspect. In the order of
                attributes - save/load(IO) - classes - upgrades - info board - combat scene (popups) - pause -
                reincarnation, I had an uneasy but clear path. Finally, when the game is at the status of playable, I
                improved the feedback prompts so they won't be misleading or confusing. The visuals have been progressly
                built up because I had enough time to look at it. I feel good about this experience. Honestly, I enjoy
                this game.

            <h2>How I Met the Requirements</h2>
            <p>Well... Really? HTML/CSS verified - valid and semantic.<br>
                Images are optimized with Photoshop and properly
                sized.<br>
                Sound is used. Utilized different fonts and
                weights.<br>
                Functionality is decent and considerate with thorough play tests - thus no JavaScript errors or
                exceptions. <br>
                Pleasing graphics, straightforward user interface...Easy to play and addcitive.<br>
                Works
                perfectly with small resolutions (not truly responsive but scales.)<br>
                A mountain of comments and follows
                code conventions. Blah blah blah...
