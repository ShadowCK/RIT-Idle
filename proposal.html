            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>This is an idle game where you play as a RIT freshman majoring in GDD. You “enroll in” classes (levels)
                to do
                exercises (enemies) of different levels, gain experience and tiger spirit. To beat the game, you must
                finish
                all your bachelor classes. </p>

        <div id="gameplay">
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The only control needed is the Left Mouse Button. The player makes decisions on which class to take (one
                at a
                time), which ability to practice and different classes benefit from different abilities. They can
                purchase
                ability upgrades as a multiplier on the ability value with tiger spirit. Higher levels unlock more
                powerful
                upgrades and more demanding (also more rewarding) classes. Each class has a problem-solving speed cap,
                restricting the max gain from a certain ability.<br>
                At a certain point of the game, the player will unlock “déjà vu”, which can restart the journey with a
                boosting factor based on their total exp earned. Engaging in the game gives extra rewards but the player
                can
                literally “idle” through the game. Going offline also gives rewards based on time.
